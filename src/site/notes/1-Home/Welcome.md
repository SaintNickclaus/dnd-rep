Welcome to Demons Demand! A short 7 session Pathfinder 1st Edition game and module adapted to the continent of Avalon (in which Bright takes places). This short little game is meant as a tutorial for you the player and me the DM learn the game. It also allows me to figure out what I wish to do whilst we figure out if Gabby is going to be available any time soon. And if she isn't, it gives me the time to make a new game within the system we are learning. It also lets me do neat stuff like this and maybe get some confidence back/improve on some bits about Avalon which were somewhat thrown together as a result of the immediacy of when it started.

Not everything here will be of equal importance, so let me list out the important stuff:
