Welcome to Wydrill, the region previously known as the Emerald Forest (which is now just the name of the forest). It is a region unlike the other corners of Avalon due to the lack of one central power or civilization. Rather unlike the other regions of Avalon which have been coerced into interconnected in the aftermath of the grand-war, this region is uncharacteristically motivated by co-operation between its many settlements old and new. 

The story takes place in the town of [[2-Locations/Haimbel\|Haimbel]], one of the rare settlements which survived the grand upheaval and thus is rich with history. With the sudden collapse of an abandoned tower near town and the disappearance of a wealthy curmudgeonly Wizard the Baroness of Haimbel, Cantlen, hires you the players to investigate what's caused it to collapse and why he has suddenly disappeared. The investigation leads to the discovery of the corpses of nearby cultists who are rumored to worship the Demon lord who first ruled over town, Deurnyx. After the Wizards belongings are put up for sale, the demon demands a ransom for many of the wizards belongings, including rare books. Giving a deadline for the demand, the players must find him before he can unleash unknown treachery onto the town...

The premise somewhat gives itself very easily to the *traditional* you are a party of adventurers who meet on the road or in a tavern. But I put some amount of effort into fleshing out the area and making it feel more alive, so feel free to take advantage of that if its a thing you desire!
