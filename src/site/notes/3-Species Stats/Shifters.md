**Change Shape (Su, 5 RP)**: A Shifter can change shape to and from a bestial form as a standard action. In bestial form, a Shifter gains a +2 racial bonus to either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. While in this form, a Shifter also takes on an animalistic feature that provides a special effect. Each time a Shifter assumes bestial form, she can choose to gain one of the following features: 
	- 2 claw attacks that each deal 1d4 points of damage
	- Darkvision to a range of 60 feet.
	- +1 racial bonus to natural armor.
These benefits last until the Shifter returns to her humanoid form as a swift action. A Shifter must first return to her humanoid form before changing to bestial form again to change benefits. Different Shifter heritages allow Shifter characters to select from different sets of bestial features (see below)
