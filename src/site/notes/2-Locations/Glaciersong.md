## **Sedarill: Guardians of the Glaciersong**

The Sedarill are a tribe of **Uncion** who stand as the sole permanent inhabitants of the frozen Glaciersong tundra. A peaceful and communal people, they are defined by their unique spiritual connection to the cold and their role as the region's protectors.

### **The Aspect of Snow**

The tribe worships **Oshanta**, the Aspect of Snow. While some theologians debate whether she is the daughter of Okratos or a deified mortal prophet, the Sedarill view her as a goddess of:

- **Assistance & Preservation:** Helping those in need and preserving life.
- **Peaceful Passing & Grief:** Guiding souls and comforting the living. Unlike the destructive worship of her kin, Oshanta’s faith is one of gentleness and service.

### **The Sedarill Code**

Living by the tenets of Oshanta, the Sedarill follow a strict moral compass:

- **Vows of Mercy:** They strongly disapprove of taking mortal lives.
- **Duty to Travelers:** They feel a sacred obligation to rescue any traveler found in peril within the tundra.
- **Kinship with Drakkars:** They act as guardians for the eggs of their **Brumul Drakkar** cousins, protecting the next generation of frost-drakes.
### **Survival & Trade**
Despite the harsh environment, the Sedarill thrive through expert scavenging, ravine fishing, and "snow trapping." Because of their unmatched knowledge of the frozen wastes, they are frequently hired as **expert guides** by third parties brave enough to venture into the deep tundra.
