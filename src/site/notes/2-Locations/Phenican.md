## **Phenican: The Rising Frontier**

Settled in 190 AU, Phenican is the newest and largest power in the region. It was founded by **The Order of the Phoenix**, a mercenary troupe led by the former Linguardian **Captain Jermaine Unsolt**. Disillusioned by the politics of the capital, Unsolt led his cavalry westward to unite several isolated hamlets into a single, thriving sovereign state.

### **The Governance of Three Hamlets**

Phenican is built on a foundation of diplomacy rather than conquest. To unify the region, Unsolt established a **Council** representing the three original hamlets. Though Unsolt acts as the settlement's leader, he refuses the title of "King," claiming the city must prove its greatness before he earns such a crown. The Council ensures that the needs of the original settlers are met, while the Order provides protection against the forest's insectoid horrors and cursed spirits.

### **A Bastion of Freedom**

Phenican has become a magnet for those fleeing the rigid structures of the Empire. It draws a diverse crowd, including:
- **Refugees:** Avalonians from Linguardian shantytowns seeking a better life.
- **Academics:** Young scholars from Epistemora looking for intellectual freedom.
- **The Faithful:** Unlike other cities, Phenican allows **freedom of worship**. It hosts a prominent church dedicated to **Sylphrena**, the goddess of nature, and is a frequent stop for the nomadic **Lavender Sojourners**.

### **The Shadow of Linguard**

As Phenican grows through both immigration and a booming birth rate, it has drawn the "ire" of the Linguardian Empire. While the Empire does not yet see the settlement as a military threat, the tension between the rising frontier and the old regime continues to simmer.
