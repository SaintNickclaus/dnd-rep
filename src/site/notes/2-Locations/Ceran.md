## **Ceran: The River’s Rest**

Ceran is a bustling riverside hamlet that serves as a vital waypoint for rafting traders. Populated primarily by **Robbits** and others seeking a fresh start away from their original societies, the town is defined by its fierce independence and its rejection of Linguardian rule.
### **Commerce and Craft**

The locals have mastered the cultivation of riverside hemp, turning it into a thriving industry. Ceran is the region’s primary source for:

- **Linen & Canvas:** High-quality textiles for clothing and sails.
- **Paper:** Essential supplies for traders and scholars alike.
### **The Phenican Partnership**

Ceran has recently found a powerful ally in **Phenican**. The larger territory pays the hamlet a monthly commission to clear debris from the river, ensuring safe passage for all vessels. This mutually beneficial deal has sparked ongoing diplomatic talks, as the fiercely independent Robbits consider officially joining Phenican’s growing territory.
