## T**he Mages Guild: Masters of the Arcane Frequency**

The Mages Guild was born from a schism at the University of Epistemora prior to the Grand War. Rejecting the rigid, scientific approach of their peers, a group of professors and their acolytes seized an abandoned upheaval-era fort to establish a sanctuary dedicated to the "living art" of magic.

### **Philosophy: Performance over Pedantry**

Unlike traditional academies, the Guild views magic as a vast, uncontrollable force that cannot be tamed by textbooks.

- **The Living Way:** They model their studies after the legendary **Three Sisters**, focusing on performance, intuition, and "feeling" the arcane.
- **The Arcane Frequency:** Members often speak of the "weave" or "frequency" with a devotion that outsiders find unsettling, leading many to label the Guild as a cult.
### **Relations**

Despite their strange reputation and isolationist lifestyle, the Guild is far from hostile. They maintain a self-sustaining community but frequently interact with the outside world by:

- **Diplomacy:** Sending gifts and offering magical aid to the leaders of **Haimbel** and **Phenican**.
- **Apprenticeships:** Dispatching students to neighboring settlements to trade services or assist with arcane problems.

### **The Fortified Campus**

The Guild’s headquarters is a repurposed ancient fortress, standing as a symbol of their independence. It serves as both a laboratory and a temple to the arcane, where the boundaries between study and worship are perpetually blurred.
