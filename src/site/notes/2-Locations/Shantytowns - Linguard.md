## **The Shantytowns: In the Shadows of Spires**

Clustered just outside the walls of every Linguardian province lie the "Shantytowns"—desperate, high-traffic hamlets that exist solely to facilitate the vices and shady dealings that the city guard won't tolerate inside the towers. While they look like slums, they are the functional playground for Linguard’s elite and the region's criminal underworld.

### **The Aristocrat’s Secret**

Ironically, many of these "poor" hamlets are owned by wealthy Linguardian aristocrats. These nobles turn a massive profit by hosting activities that are too risky or cramped for the inner city, including:

- **High-Stakes Gambling:** More secure and private than the rowdy street games within the provinces.
- **Illicit Trades:** Open markets for restricted drugs, specialized escorts, and contraband.
- **Caravan Waystations:** Traveling performers and traders often choose these outskirts because the provincial towers lack the physical space to accommodate them.

### **A Lawless Convenience**

While Linguardians enjoy the "fresh air" outside the walls, these settlements are dangerous for those without connections. They serve as a neutral ground where unsavory figures, outsiders, and disillusioned citizens can mingle. In the Shantytowns, gold and influence are the only laws that truly matter, making them the perfect place to find information—or trouble.
