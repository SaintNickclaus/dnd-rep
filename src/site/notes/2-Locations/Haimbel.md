## **Haimbel: The Crossroads of Old and New**

Haimbel is the oldest settlement in the region and its second-largest hub of commerce. Built upon the ruins of a demon warlord’s domain at the dawn of **The Rekindling**, the town is a living intersection of Avalon’s dark past and its hopeful future.

### **The Reign of the Uriske**

The town’s modern history began after "The Flash-Flood," a cataclysmic event that purged the original demon presence but leveled much of the architecture. In the aftermath, an Uriske warrior named **Mondeptus** took command. He led the reconstruction but ruled with an iron fist for generations, enforcing a tyrannical regime and mandating the worship of the god **Okratos**.

### **The Liberation of Cantlen**

During the Grand War, a fleeing Warden from Poleren named **Cantlen** arrived in Haimbel. Seizing a moment of Uriske weakness, Cantlen and his loyal guards overthrew Mondeptus, ending his long and bloody rule. Unlike his predecessor, Cantlen abolished forced worship and governed with justice. Today, a statue of the "Old Kanith" wielding his axe stands in the town square—a tribute to the man who gave Haimbel its freedom.

### **Haimbel Today**

Now ruled by **Baroness Cantlen**, the town has flourished into a peaceful community of farmers and tradesmen. It is the primary rival to the city of Linguard; most neighbors prefer Haimbel’s goods over those of the capital.

Beyond its markets, Haimbel has recently become a haven for **independent magic scholars**. These young mages seek a path separate from both the established Mages Guild and the ruins of Epistemora, turning the town into a burgeoning center for unorthodox arcane study.
