## **Herish: The Shore of Black Mist

Herish is an ancient coastal village founded during the final years of the Upheaval. It was settled on a grim gamble: that the demons of Avalon would fear the cursed undead of the **Isle of Ishmeit** more than they hungered for settlers. The village's survival into the modern era is seen by locals as living proof that their ancestors were right to hide in the shadow of the cursed isle.

### **The Black Pearl Economy**

While most of Avalon relies on farming, Herish looks to the sea. The village is famous across the continent for its **Black Pearls**, rare gems harvested from the coastal waters that fetch high prices from nobility. Between the pearl trade and a steady supply of seafood, Herish has become a wealthy, self-sustaining community with little need for inland agriculture.

### **Shell-Breaking and Prophecy**

The "Cursed Waters" are treacherous, and the people of Herish trust omens over gods. They follow the tradition of **The Shell-Shattering**:

- Each morning, a gifted seer takes the shell of the first crustacean caught by the fishermen.
- The shell is cast into a fire, and the patterns of its cracking are used to gauge the day’s danger.
- No boat leaves the harbor if the prophecy warns of a high tide of undead or black mist
### **Leadership**

The village maintains a balance between tradition and democracy. It is governed by **Lord Estermal**, a descendant of the town’s original founder, and a **Sheriff** elected by the "Herishites" to handle local law and order.
